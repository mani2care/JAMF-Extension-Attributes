#
# None
# AdoptOpenJDK
# Amazon
# Apple
# Azul
# OpenJDK
# Oracle
# SAP
# Unknown
# 
#
# None = No Java JDK is installed.
# AdoptOpenJDK = AdoptOpenJDK is the Java JDK vendor.
# Amazon = Amazon is the Java JDK vendor.
# Apple = Apple is the Java JDK vendor.
# Azul = Azul is the Java JDK vendor.
# OpenJDK = OpenJDK is the Java JDK vendor.
# Oracle = Oracle is the Java JDK vendor.
# SAP = SAP is the Java JDK vendor.
# Unknown = There is a Java JDK installed, but it is not from one of the listed vendors.
